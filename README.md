# Udacity Wander project

Location is more than just a place. It can be distance, it can be an area, a destination, or it can be movement. As such, apps use location in many different ways. Locations can be used to fill out a form, tag a photo, track your workouts, draw a map, restrict usage to certain areas, or relate to others. How do the apps you use utilize location to enhance their feature list? Start by looking through your system permissions and which apps request Location permissions.

How do these apps use location?
Does that enhance the experience for the user?
Is it required for the feature?
What type of location level do they use?
When are you asked for permissions? (disable permissions and restart the app if you don’t remember)
What happens if you don’t grant them?
